**Current Status:** Two separate demos  
**Next Step:** Integrate graph canvas into the Figma-based board interface

## Quick Start

```bash
# Figma Base UI
cd "Initial Website - Figma"
npm install
npm run dev

# Graph Canvas Demo
cd "Graph and Canvas Demo"
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- React (18/19) + TypeScript
